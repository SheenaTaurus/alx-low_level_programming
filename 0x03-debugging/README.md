This program prints the largest of three integers.
Fix the code in 2-largest number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3 Leap year
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.

Fix the print remaining days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

Line count will not be checked for this task.
You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
